    <p>
      Thanks for visiting my portfolio! My name is Brett New, and I am an aspiring web developer and student at Epicodus in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from BYU in 2013 with a B.A. in Middle Eastern Studies and Arabic. After graduating, I worked at a natural gas utilities company in Shreveport, Louisiana (it was...an <em>interesting</em> experience). I read an article about coding bootcamps, did some research, decided Epicodus was the one for me, and moved to Portland!
